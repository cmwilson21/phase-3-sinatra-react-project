# Show Library Server Side

## About
This is the server side of the Show Library, built with Sinatra.

## Set Up
Fork and clone this repo and the repo titled show-and-character-client to have copies of both the front-end and back-end. The front-end repo will have a README with instructions on how to start the React front-end.

Run bundle install
Run shotgun

## Functionality
This repo connects all the dots between the front end React app and the Sinatra API. When a new show or character is created, the database will update with the new information. When a link is clicked, the route to the proper information will be followed, allowing the React front end to display our data.
